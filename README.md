A random generator written in Java.

# System requirements
OS: Windows 7 SP1¹ or newer (amd64); Windows Server 2012 or newer (amd64); macOS 10.11² or newer (Intel, Apple Silicon); Solaris 11.3³ or newer (SPARC); RHEL 6 (amd64), Oracle Linux 6 (amd64, Aarch64⁴), Suse Linux Enterprise Server 12 (amd64), Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS (amd64), distributions based on one of those or newer
Java: Java 11⁵ or newer
Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.4 GHz or equivalent
RAM: 4 GB (6 GB if running Windows 11)
HDD: 2 MB free disk space (really small, right?)

¹ Windows 7 is no longer supported by Microsoft. Support requests from Windows 7 users will not be prioritized.
² The creator of this program hasn't got a Mac and therefore macOS support requests will not be prioritized.
³ The creator must emulate the architecture for Solaris and even then - eventually isn't able to get Java binaries for the platform legally. Support requests will not be prioritized.
⁴ Only Oracle Linux 7.6+ can handle this program on Aarch64 machines. Additionally, support requests will be resolved very slowly due to emulation being required.
⁵ The official Oracle binaries are not free for anything but development and testing purposes. Using the Adoptium Temurin binaries is recommended. You can get them here: https://adoptium.net/de/

# Installation
Just download the JAR file and run the program after installing Java. Easy, right?

# Building
Just download the source code and run Eclipse. I recommend beginning a new project and copy the source code into new files. Then you can run it. If it works, right click on src, then choose Export, expand Java, click on Runnable JAR file, follow the instructions and - done!

# Contribution
You must open a new issue before making contributions. But then, feel free to apply your plans to the program.

# Forking
This program is licensed under MIT. That means you can fork it and make it your own with little restrictions. Isn't that cool?
