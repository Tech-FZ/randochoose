Randochoose 2022.10.0
- Completion: 30th October, 2022
- You can now choose between normal and group randomization.
- In group randomization, you can control the maximum size of a group (between 2 and 8 are supported) and the results are shown in a table.

Randochoose 2022.9.0
- Completion: September 2022
- Randochoose 0.2.x and older just picked from the candidates you typed in. That wasn't the best solution - that's why I'm happy to announce that the randomizing algorithm is a bit more complex now. Starting with this version of Randochoose, the list will be shuffled as many times as the number of your candidates before they are chosen.
- Also, the versioning scheme has been changed from x.y.z (0.2.x and older) to y.m.r (like 2022.9.0, 2022.9.1 etc.). y is the year, m the month and r tells you if it is the first/second/... release within a month.
- README.md has been corrected and updated.
- The updater only checks the version code from now on.

Randochoose 0.2.4 Alpha
- Completion: 18th September, 2022
- This is an emergency update - I forgot to update the maximum number of indexes in the second stage of the updater. That causes 0.2.3 to not notify about updates.

Randochoose 0.2.3 Alpha
- Completion: 18th September, 2022
- The update checker got another upgrade: EmuGUI's version code is now included into Randochoose as well. This will allow us to work on "revisions" without altering the version string. Don't worry, I made sure you will still be able to be notified with 0.2.2.

Randochoose 0.2.2 Alpha
- Completion: 20th August, 2022
- It took me long to get into the mood to update Randochoose again, but the only change is that you can now choose if you rather want to get Randochoose from GitHub or from Codeberg.
